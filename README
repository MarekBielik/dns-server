DESCRIPTION

RoughDNS is a recursive, concurrent DNS server, which supports various resource
record types and runs over UDP on Unix-like systems. It is written in C++ 
according to RFC 1035 and RFC 1034 and it also supports multiple zone files
(utilizing an open source library - https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/).

Supported resource records: A, AAAA, SOA, MX, NS, TXT, PTR and CNAME.

COMPILATION

You can compile the program by the cmake utility, providing you have the ldns
library installed.

USAGE

./roughDNS [-m <ip_addr>] [-h] [-p <port#>] [<zonefile1>] [<zonefileX>]

-m [--mitm] <ip_address>
Responds to every A and MX query with the given IP address. This parameter
simulates the man in the middle attack. Other records are served
in the standard way.

-h [--help]
Prints out a simple user manual.

-p [--port] <port number>
The server will bind its socket with the given port number. If not specified,
the standard port number will be used - 53.

The last optional parameters are the paths to zone files. The resource records
specified in the zone files must be unique.
